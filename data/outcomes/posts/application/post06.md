## 연구 요약 

- Professor Pan, from the Department of Mathematics at Shanghai University, leads research into the Non-Oberbeck-Boussinesq (NOB) effects in Rayleigh-Bénard convection (RBC).
- The group utilizes high-performance solvers, specifically PaScaL_TDMA and PaScaL_FFT, to analyze NOB effects in RBC problems.
- The large-scale turbulent solver allows for an in-depth investigation of how various parameters impact RBC dynamics, leveraging high-parallel computation to optimize turbulence simulation and parameter analysis.

## 수치 라이브러리 기여 부분 

- Using the PaScaL_TDMA and PaScaL_FFT libraries, data communication costs were reduced, leading to a decrease in overall computational time by approximately 30%.
- Using the large-scale turbulent solver, the influence of NOB in RBC was analyzed and published in several papers in journals such as International Communications in Heat and Mass Transfer, Physics of Fluids, and others.
